Explorations in artificial intelligence.

In this branch is some older, working code that demonstrates the evolution of neural
networks using genomic evolution. The neural networks are built using a genome, and
the most successful neural network's baseline genomes are used to construct
the next generation. There is no recognition here of epigenetics, e.g. only the
starting genome of each neural network is used in future generations.
